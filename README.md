# PRISM_analysis_courtrooms

The sub-directory 'Codes' contains a Jupyter notebook which constructs the PRISM model from the pre-processed data-sets
(https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/supreme.html) of the two years of 2018-19 which are stored as csv files 
named out1.csv and out2.csv respectively. The code is written in Python. The code outputs the PRISM model.

The sub-directory 'PRISM_Files' contains the PRISM model in the 'Model' directory and the Properties discussed in the
paper in the 'Properties' directory. The name of each query is saved as 'Query_i' where i refers to the property number 
it corresponds to in the paper. The queries discussed in the appendix are saved as 'Appendix_Queries.props'.

One can build the PRISM model and run the experiments using the PRISM model checker which is available at 
https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/ with all other necessary documentation nicely presented at 
https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/manual/. In case of any issues, please write to 'susmoy18@iiserb.ac.in'. 

P.S. I am new to Github.
